# `febama`: Feature-based Bayesian Forecasting Model Averaging


## TODO

- [ ] Do we need to have full cumulative time series features? We could just calculate the
      feature with a moving window.
- [ ] Write a gradient function for the log score
- [ ] Replace optimization function with SGD
- [ ] Parallel the code
- [ ] Package the code
